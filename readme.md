# Micro Journal

Discovering the Micro Journal has been a game-changer for me in my writing journey. It's more than just a tool; it's a sanctuary for undistracted creativity.

Let me walk you through the two versions I've personally crafted and use:

## Micro Journal Rev.3 - Samsung Galaxy s8

This is a build that is based on an old phone. Pairing it with a hand-wired mechanical keyboard, I've transformed it into a haven for focused writing sessions. Powered by Android apps and internet connectivity, it seamlessly integrates research needs into my writing process. Plus, it doubles as a convenient media player when connected to a Bluetooth speaker.

While it's incredibly user-friendly and accessible for DIY enthusiast, I must admit, it does come with its temptations. With the vast array of apps and online distractions, discipline is key. But for those willing to exercise self-control, it's a gem of a tool.

# Micro Journal Rev.2 - Raspberry Pi 

However, my heart truly lies with the Micro Journal Rev.2, crafted around the Raspberry Pi Zero 2W. This compact marvel features a 30-key mechanical keyboard and an 8-inch wide screen, creating the ultimate focused writing environment.

This is my favorite build for writing. This device completely blocks for any distraction available and helps you to focus on writing. It is running on a linux environment, and using writing software with basic writing tools in linux such as vi, nano, and micro.

For those with a penchant for tinkering and building, I highly recommend this version. There's something magical about having a dedicated device solely for writing. Trust me, the results are astounding.
