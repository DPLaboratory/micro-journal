# Micro Journal Rev.7

Micro Journal Rev.7 is distraction-free writing device based on e-ink screen and hot-swappable mechanical keyboard that you can power-on and start writing immediately. 

### Micro Journal Rev.7 consists of

* Assembled 3D printed enclosure
* 4.7 inch Ultra-low Power E-papaer display
* Assembled Cherry MX profile keyboard PCB
* QMK-VIAL firmware, Rasbperry Pi Pico Micro Controller 
* 18650 LIPO Battery **holder**. (Battery not included) 
* 18650 LIPO Battery Charger

**Note:** Mechanical switches and keycaps are not included in the base price. Also the book light is not included. LIPO battery is NOT included. EU delivery restrictions prevent batteries in the parcel. The device requires one 18650 battery to operate. Please source the battery separately.


### Include mechanical switches and keycaps 

Opt for the "**include mechanical switches and keycaps**" option to receive a fully assembled device, requiring only battery installation. Your switches will be offering an incredible tactile sensation and a pleasing sound profile, striking a balance between clacky and linear switches. These switches are immensely satisfying and happen to be my personal favorite. Moreover, this option retains the hot-swappable socketed PCB feature, enabling future mechanical keyboard switch changes at your convenience.

* [Silent Switch VS Clicky Switch Comparison](https://youtu.be/9zu-tkawMV0)

Silent switch is very silent and it is adequate to use in a place where you need to keep the noise level in check. Keyboard noise is mainly caused when the key press reaches the bottom and the sound is coming from the clash to the floor. Silent switches makes it feel like the last part of the clash is soften out by a sponge. It feels like the register is landing to the cloud. A soft landing.

### Usage Video 

Please, watch the use case video in order to understand the features and most importantly, limitation of the device. This version of micro journal is focused on drafting. It is possible to go around with cursor navigation and edit. However, it is not optimized for the editing purpose. Also, the e-ink display presents delays and can be limiting for certain groups of people. Please, check the video to get the idea of the features.
