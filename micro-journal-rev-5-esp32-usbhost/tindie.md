## Why did you make it?

I've been scouring the internet for WriterDeck builds that incorporate microcontrollers like the ESP32 or similar options. Ideally, I'm seeking a device that powers on instantly, creating a conducive writing environment, and has the added convenience of syncing with Google Drive.

I couldn't find such a solution online, likely because it caters to a niche demand in the market. WriterDeck itself represents a niche interest, and the idea of a DIY solution using a microcontroller seemed like an exceptionally rare occurrence rather than a widely recognized concept.

I aimed to acquire a dedicated device that allows me to type immediately, facilitating the collection of meeting notes or capturing fleeting ideas before they fade. While I've explored various iterations of a WriterDeck, none of them offer the crucial feature of instant powering on.

So, I decided to build one by myself.


## What makes it special?

It's perfect for capturing sudden bursts of inspiration or quickly jotting down important tasks or ideas. It's a device that can be kept on your bedside table, ready to record your dreams at a moment's notice. All you need to do is find the power switch before immortalizing your weirdest dream ever in writing.

## User Reviews

I've been searching for something like this for years. Alphasmarts were close, but the keyboard was where they fell down, I always wanted to use my mechanical keyboards. I had ideas of a Raspberry Pi box and a small monitor, but they always felt too much like the dekstops/laptops I wanted to get away from.
