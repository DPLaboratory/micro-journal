# Micro Journal Rev.6: Write with Style

## Enjoy Distraction-Free Writing

A playwright from New York once asked for a writing device he could carry around, use in cafés, and not be ashamed to show off. He wanted something compact, practical, and distraction-free—something stylish.

Introducing the Micro Journal: a blend of modern practicality and stylish minimalism. This compact, sleek device features a distinctive design with a bold colored border contrasting against white keys. It’s a hot-swappable mechanical keyboard, allowing for hyper-personalization. Easy to carry with its leather straps, it’s perfect for writers on the go.

Micro Journal seamlessly combines functionality with personality, making it ideal for capturing spontaneous ideas and drafting stories wherever inspiration strikes, be it a café, park, or during travels. Its chic, contemporary look makes it a fashionable and practical tool for any writer.
