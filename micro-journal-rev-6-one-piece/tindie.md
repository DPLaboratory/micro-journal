## Purchase Options Explained

### Do you want ready to use device?

Opt for the "**include mechanical switches and keycaps**" option to receive a fully assembled device, requiring only battery installation. Your switches will be the "Akko V3 Pro Cream Blue", offering an incredible tactile sensation and a pleasing sound profile, striking a balance between clacky and linear switches. These switches are immensely satisfying and happen to be my personal favorite. Moreover, this option retains the hot-swappable socketed PCB feature, enabling future mechanical keyboard switch changes at your convenience.


### Do you want to choose your own Mechanical Keyboard Switches and Keycaps?

Opt for the "**without switches and keycaps**" option to receive a fully assembled device with a PCB soldered with a hot-swappable socketed feature. This economical choice is ideal for individuals who already possess mechanical switches or seek personalized switch options.
