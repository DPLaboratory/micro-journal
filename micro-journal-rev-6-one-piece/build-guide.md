# Build Guide

This is a build for Micro Journal Rev.6. This guide allows you to build one on your own. Also, providing detailed information to trouble shoot when some parts of the build fails. Or, for someone wants to know how Micro Journal Rev.6 is built, this guide will resolve many of your curiosity. 

You need to know how to solder in order to complete this guide. It doesn't require you to have advanced soldering skills. All the components will be through the hole types, and with some practice, you should be able to reach a sufficient level to achieve the build.

You will need 3D prints, in order to complete the build. There should be many 3d printing services available. In case, you want to build you own, but having difficulty supplying the components, then contact me and I will try to find a way to send you a type of DIY-kit. 


# Build Order

1) Prepare the Enclosure
2) Build Keyboard PCB
3) Wire up with ESP32
4) Power Supply 
5) Display 
6) Switches and Keycaps


# Enclosure Preparation

[STL files](https://github.com/unkyulee/micro-journal/tree/main/micro-journal-rev-6-one-piece/STL) for the 3D prints are available in the github.

Please, refer to the image below for placement of the prints. Most of the prints requries support. I have used tree support for the best results. Bolts do not need supports. Protection lid requires to be as straight as possible on a vertical diretion in order to get the most smooth surface. I have used PLA for the print material.

Once the prints are done. Remove the support materials from the print. 


# Keyboard PCB

[Gerber File](https://github.com/unkyulee/micro-journal/tree/main/micro-journal-rev-6-one-piece/STL) for the 3D prints are available in the github.
